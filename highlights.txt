Arkwright is particularly remembered for the efficient
and profitable way that he ran his factories.

---

When wigs became less popular, he started to work in
textiles. Richard Arkwright improved the original
carding machine. Carding is the process of preparing
fibres for spinning into yarn and fabric. He also developed
horse-driven spinning mills that used only one machine

---

Richard Arkwright (1732–92) Born in 1732, Arkwright
originally trained and worked as a barber.

---

The development of the Bessemer process for the mass
production of steel led to the development of the
shipbuilding industry and the railways. Manufacturing
jobs became the main source of employment in Britain.

---

Britain was the first country to industrialise on a large
scale

---

The Industrial Revolution was the rapid development of
industry in Britain in the 18th and 19th centuries

---

Before the 18th century, agriculture was the biggest
source of employment in Britain. There were many cottage
industries, where people worked from home to produce goods
such as cloth and lace.

---

One of the most important principles of the Enlightenment
was that everyone should have the right to their own
political and religious beliefs and that the state should
not try to dictate to them. This continues to be an important
principle in the UK today.

---

Scientific discoveries, such as James Watt’s work on
steam power, helped the progress of the Industrial
Revolution

---

David Hume’s ideas about human nature continue to
influence philosophers

---

Adam Smith developed ideas about economics which are still
referred to today

---

Many of the great thinkers of the Enlightenment were
Scottish

---

During the 18th century, new ideas about politics,
philosophy and science were developed. This is often
called 'the Enlightenment

---

Burns' best-known work is probably the song Auld Lang Syne,
which is sung by people in the UK and other countries when
they are celebrating the New Year (or Hogmanay as it is
called in Scotland).

---

Robert Burns (1759–96) Known in Scotland as 'The Bard',
Robert Burns was a Scottish poet. He wrote in the Scots
language, English with some Scottish words, and standard
English. He also revised a lot of traditional folk songs by
changing or adding lyrics

---

A process began which became known as the 'Highland
Clearances'. Many Scottish landlords destroyed
individual small farms (known as 'crofts') to make space
for large flocks of sheep and cattle. Evictions became very
common in the early 19th century. Many Scottish people left
for North America at this time.

---

The clans lost a lot of their power and influence after
Culloden. Chieftains became landlords if they had the
favour of the English king, and clansmen became tenants who
had to pay for the land they used.

---

Charles Edward Stuart initially had some successes but was
defeated by George II's army at the Battle of Culloden in
1746. Charles escaped back to Europe.

---

In 1745 there was another attempt to put a Stuart king back on
the throne in place of George I's son, George II. Charles
Edward Stuart (Bonnie Prince Charlie), the grandson of
James II, landed in Scotland.

---

The first man to be called prime minister was Sir Robert
Walpole, who was Prime Minister from 1721 to 1742

---

George I did not speak very good English and this increased
his need to rely on his ministers. The most important
minister in Parliament became known as the Prime Minister

---

The Act of Union, known as the Treaty of Union in Scotland,
was therefore agreed in 1707, creating the Kingdom of Great
Britain. Although Scotland was no longer an independent
country, it kept its own legal and education systems and
Presbyterian Church.

---

William III and Mary’s successor, Queen Anne, had no
surviving children.

---

The first Jews to come to Britain since the Middle Ages
settled in London in 1656. Between 1680 and 1720 many
refugees called Huguenots came from France. They were
Protestants and had been persecuted for their religion.
Many were educated and skilled and worked as scientists, in
banking, or in weaving or other crafts.

---

Only men who owned property of a certain value were able to
vote. No women at all had the vote. Some constituencies were
controlled by a single wealthy family. These were called
‘pocket boroughs’. Other constituencies had hardly
any voters and were called ‘rotten boroughs

---

After William III, the ministers gradually became more
important than the monarch but this was not a democracy in
the modern sense

---

The laws passed after the Glorious Revolution are the
beginning of what is called ‘constitutional
monarchy’

---

From 1695, newspapers were allowed to operate without a
government licence. Increasing numbers of newspapers
began to be published.

---

These changes meant that, to be able to govern effectively,
the monarch needed to have advisers, or ministers, who
would be able to ensure a majority of votes in the House of
Commons and the House of Lords. There were two main groups in
Parliament, known as the Whigs and the Tories. (The modern
Conservative Party is still sometimes referred to as the
Tories.) This was the beginning of party politics.

---

The Bill of Rights, 1689, confirmed the rights of
Parliament and the limits of the king’s power.
Parliament took control of who could be monarch and
declared that the king or queen must be a Protestant. A new
Parliament had to be elected at least every three years
(later this became seven years and now it is five years).
Every year the monarch had to ask Parliament to renew
funding for the army and the navy.

---

At the coronation of William III and Mary, a Declaration of
Rights was read. This confirmed that the king would no
longer be able to raise taxes or administer justice without
agreement from Parliament

---

Some continued to believe that James II was the rightful
king, particularly in Scotland. Some joined him in exile in
France; others were secret supporters. James’
supporters became known as Jacobites.

---

The MacDonalds of Glencoe were late in taking the oath of
William III and were all killed. The memory of this massacre
meant some Scots distrusted the new government

---

There was also support for James II in Scotland. An attempt
at an armed rebellion in support of James was quickly
defeated at Killiecrankie. All Scottish clans were
required formally to accept William as king by taking an
oath

---

William III re-conquered Ireland and James II fled back to
France. Many restrictions were placed on the Roman
Catholic Church in Ireland and Irish Catholics were unable
to take part in the government

---

James II wanted to regain the throne and invaded Ireland
with the help of a French army. William III defeated James II
at the Battle of the Boyne in Ireland in 1690, an event which
is still celebrated by some in Northern Ireland today

---

William III ruled jointly with Mary. This event was later
called the ‘Glorious Revolution’ because there was no
fighting in England and because it guaranteed the power of
Parliament, ending the threat of a monarch ruling on his or
her own as he or she wished

---

In 1688, important Protestants in England asked William to
invade England and proclaim himself king. When William
reached England, there was no resistance. James II fled to
France and William took over the throne, becoming William
III in England, Wales and Ireland, and William II of
Scotland

---

Newton also discovered that white light is made up of the
colours of the rainbow

---

Newton became an important figure in the field. His most
famous published work was Philosophiae Naturalis
Principia Mathematica (‘Mathematical Principles of
Natural Philosophy’), which showed how gravity applied
to the whole universe.

---

Born in Lincolnshire, eastern England, Isaac Newton first
became interested in science when he studied at Cambridge
University

---

Isaac Newton (1643–1727)

---

Among royal society's early members were Sir Edmund
Halley, who successfully predicted the return of the comet
now called Halley’s Comet, and Sir Isaac Newton

---

Charles II was interested in science. During his reign, the
Royal Society was formed to promote ‘natural
knowledge’. This is the oldest surviving scientific
society in the world

---

The Habeas Corpus Act became law in 1679 during the reign of
Charles II. This was a very important piece of legislation
which remains relevant today. Habeas corpus is Latin for
‘you must present the person in court’. The Act
guaranteed that no one could be held prisoner unlawfully.
Every prisoner has a right to a court hearing

---

Samuel Pepys wrote about these events (1665 plague of
London and 1666 fire of London) during the reign of Charles
II in a diary which was later published and is still read
today

---

During Charles II’s reign, in 1665, there was a major
outbreak of plague in London. Thousands of people died,
especially in poorer areas. The following year, a great
fire destroyed much of the city, including many churches
and St Paul’s Cathedral

---

The Church of England again became the established
official Church during the reign of Charles II. Both Roman
Catholics and Puritans were kept out of power

---

In May 1660, Parliament invited Charles II to come back from
exile in the Netherlands. He was crowned King Charles II of
England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland

---

Although Britain had been a republic for 11 years, without
Oliver Cromwell there was no clear leader or system of
government. Many people in the country wanted stability.
People began to talk about the need for a king.

---

When Cromwell died, his son, Richard, became Lord
Protector in his place but was not able to control the army or
the government

---

After his campaign in Ireland and victory over Charles II at
Worcester, Cromwell was recognised as the leader of the new
republic. He was given the title of Lord Protector and ruled
until his death in 1658

---

Cromwell defeated this army in the Battles of Dunbar and
Worcester. Charles II escaped from Worcester, famously
hiding in an oak tree on one occasion, and eventually fled to
Europe. Parliament now controlled Scotland as well as
England and Wales.

---

The Scots had not agreed to the execution of Charles I and
declared his son Charles II to be king. He was crowned king of
Scotland and led a Scottish army into England

---

One of its generals, Oliver Cromwell, was sent to Ireland,
where the revolt which had begun in 1641 still continued and
where there was still a Royalist army. Cromwell was
successful in establishing the authority of the English
Parliament but did this with such violence that even today
Cromwell remains a controversial figure in Ireland

---

England declared itself a republic, called the
Commonwealth. It no longer had a monarch

---

Charles was held prisoner by the parliamentary army. He was
still unwilling to reach any agreement with Parliament and
in 1649 he was executed

---

The king’s army was defeated at the Battles of Marston
Moor and Naseby. By 1646, it was clear that Parliament had
won the war

---

Civil war between the king and Parliament could not now be
avoided and began in 1642. The country split into those who
supported the king (the Cavaliers) and those who supported
Parliament (the Roundheads)

---

(No monarch has set foot in the Commons since Charles I.

---

Parliament took this opportunity to demand control of the
English army – a change that would have transferred
substantial power from the king to Parliament. In
response, Charles I entered the House of Commons and tried
to arrest five parliamentary leaders, but they had been
warned and were not there

---

Another rebellion began in Ireland because the Roman
Catholics in Ireland were afraid of the growing power of the
Puritans

---

In 1640, Charles I recalled Parliament to ask it for funds.
Many in Parliament were Puritans, a group of Protestants
who advocated strict and simple religious doctrine and
worship. They did not agree with the king’s religious
views and disliked his reforms of the Church of England.
Parliament refused to give the king the money he asked for,
even after the Scottish army invaded England.

---

A Scottish army was formed and Charles could not find the
money he needed for his own army without the help of
Parliament

---

Charles I tried to impose this Prayer Book on the
Presbyterian Church in Scotland and this led to serious
unrest

---

Charles I wanted the worship of the Church of England to
include more ceremony and introduced a revised Prayer Book

---

For 11 years, Charles I found ways in which to raise money
without Parliament’s approval but eventually trouble
in Scotland meant that he had to recall Parliament.

---

When Charles I could not get Parliament to agree with his
religious and foreign policies, he tried to rule without
Parliament at all

---

James I and his son Charles I were less skilled politically.
Both believed in the ‘Divine Right of Kings’

---

Elizabeth I was very skilled at managing Parliament.

---

These settlements were known as plantations. Many of the
new settlers came from south-west Scotland and other land
was given to companies based in London

---

The English government encouraged Scottish and English
Protestants to settle in Ulster, the northern province of
Ireland, taking over the land from Catholic landholders

---

During the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I, many people in
Ireland opposed rule by the Protestant government in
England. There were a number of rebellions

---

Henry VIII took the title ‘King of Ireland’. English
laws were introduced and local leaders were expected to
follow the instructions of the Lord Lieutenants in Dublin.

---

Henry VII and Henry VIII had extended English control
outside the Pale and had established English authority
over the whole country

---

During the period of king James I rule, Ireland was an almost
completely Catholic country

---

One achievement of King James’ reign was a new
translation of the Bible into English. This translation is
known as the ‘King James Version’ or the ‘Authorised
Version’. It was not the first English Bible but is a
version which continues to be used in many Protestant
churches today.

---

Elizabeth I never married and so had no children of her own to
inherit her throne. When she died in 1603 her heir was James
VI of Scotland. He became King James I of England, Wales and
Ireland but Scotland remained a separate country.

---

The Globe Theatre in London is a modern copy of the theatres
in which his plays were first performed.

---

The darling buds of May (Sonnet 18 – Shall I Compare Thee To
A Summer’s Day).

---

All the world’s a stage (As You Like It)

---

A rose by any other name (Romeo and Juliet)

---

To be or not to be (Hamlet)

---

Once more unto the breach (Henry V)

---

Shakespeare had a great influence on the English language
and invented many words that are still common today

---

His most famous plays include A Midsummer Night’s Dream,
Hamlet, Macbeth and Romeo and Juliet.

---

Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, England.

---

William Shakespeare (1564–1616)

---

The Elizabethan period is also remembered for the richness
of its poetry and drama, especially the plays and poems of
William Shakespeare.

---

In Elizabeth I’s time, English settlers first began to
colonise the eastern coast of America. This colonisation,
particularly by people who disagreed with the religious
views of the next two kings, greatly increased in the next
century.

---

Sir Francis Drake, one of the commanders in the defeat of the
Spanish Armada, was one of the founders of England’s
naval tradition. His ship, the Golden Hind, was one of the
first to sail right around (‘circumnavigate’) the
world.

---

The Elizabethan period in England was a time of growing
patriotism: a feeling of pride in being English

---

Mary was Elizabeth I’s cousin and hoped that Elizabeth
might help her, but Elizabeth suspected Mary of wanting to
take over the English throne, and kept her a prisoner for 20
years. Mary was eventually executed, accused of plotting
against Elizabeth I.

---

When Mary's husband was murdered, Mary was suspected of
involvement and fled to England. She gave her throne to her
Protestant son, James VI of Scotland

---

The queen of Scotland, Mary Stuart (often now called
‘Mary, Queen of Scots’) was a Catholic. She was only a
week old when her father died and she became queen. Much of
her childhood was spent in France

---

In 1560, the predominantly Protestant Scottish
Parliament abolished the authority of the Pope in Scotland
and Roman Catholic religious services became illegal. A
Protestant Church of Scotland with an elected leadership
was established but, unlike in England, this was not a state
Church.

---

Elizabeth became one of the most popular monarchs in
English history, particularly after 1588, when the
English defeated the Spanish Armada (a large fleet of
ships), which had been sent by Spain to conquer England and
restore Catholicism.

---

Elizabeth did not ask about people’s real beliefs. She
succeeded in finding a balance between the views of
Catholics and the more extreme Protestants

---

Queen Elizabeth I was a Protestant. She re-established the
Church of England as the official Church in England

---

Mary was a devout Catholic and persecuted Protestants (for
this reason, she became known as ‘Bloody Mary’). Mary
also died after a short reign and the next monarch was her
half-sister, Elizabeth, the daughter of Henry VIII and
Anne Boleyn.

---

Edward died at the age of 15 after ruling for just over six
years, and his half-sister Mary became queen

---

During the reign of Henry VIII, Wales became formally
united with England by the Act for the Government of Wales.
The Welsh sent representatives to the House of Commons and
the Welsh legal system was reformed.

---

In Ireland, however, attempts by the English to impose
Protestantism (alongside efforts to introduce the
English system of laws about the inheritance of land) led to
rebellion from the Irish chieftains, and much brutal
fighting followed.

---

Protestant ideas gradually gained strength in England,
Wales and Scotland during the 16th century.

---

The Protestants formed their own churches. They read the
Bible in their own languages instead of in Latin; they did
not pray to saints or at shrines; and they believed that a
person’s own relationship with God was more important
than submitting to the authority of the Church

---

To divorce his first wife, Henry needed the approval of the
Pope. When the Pope refused, Henry established the Church
of England. In this new Church, the king, not the Pope, would
have the power to appoint bishops and order how people
should worship.

---

Catherine Parr – the sixth wife of Henry viii, Catherine
Parr was a widow who married Henry late in his life. She
survived him and married again but died soon after.

---

Catherine Howard – the fifth wife of Henry viii,
Catherine Howard was a cousin of Anne Boleyn. She was also
accused of taking lovers and executed.

---

Anne of Cleves – the forth wife of Henry viii, Anne was a
German princess. Henry married her for political reasons
but divorced her soon after

---

Jane Seymour – the third wife of Henry viii, Henry married
Jane Seymour after Anne Boleyn’s execution. She gave
Henry the son he wanted, Edward, but she died shortly after
the birth

---

Anne Boleyn – the second wife of Henry viii, Anne Boleyn
was English. She and Henry had one daughter, Elizabeth.
Anne Boleyn was unpopular in the country and was accused of
taking lovers. She was executed at the Tower of London

---

Catherine of Aragon – the first wife of Henry viii,
Catherine was a Spanish princess. She and Henry had a number
of children but only one, Mary, survived. When Catherine
was too old to give him another child, Henry decided to
divorce her, hoping that another wife would give him a son to
be his heir

---

Henry VIII was most famous for breaking away from the Church
of Rome and marrying six times.

---

Henry was the first king of the House of Tudor. The symbol of
the House of Tudor was a red rose with a white rose inside it as
a sign that the Houses of York and Lancaster were now allies.

---

King Richard III of the House of York was killed in the battle
and Henry Tudor, the leader of the House of Lancaster,
became King Henry VII. Henry then married King Richard’s
niece, Elizabeth of York, and united the two families

---

This war was called the Wars of the Roses, because the symbol
of Lancaster was a red rose and the symbol of York was a white
rose. The war ended with the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485

---

In 1455, a civil war was begun to decide who should be king of
England. It was fought between the supporters of two
families: the House of Lancaster and the House of York

---

English wool became a very important export.

---

Lincoln Cathedral – were also built, and many of these are
still used for worship. Several of the cathedrals had
windows of stained glass, telling stories about the Bible
and Christian saints. The glass in York Minster is a famous
example.

---

John Barbour, who wrote The Bruce about the Battle of
Bannockburn.

---

In Scotland, many people continued to speak Gaelic and the
Scots language also developed.

---

William Caxton, the first person in England to print books
using a printing press.

---

In the years leading up to 1400, Geoffrey Chaucer wrote a
series of poems in English about a group of people going to
Canterbury on a pilgrimage. This collection of poems is
called The Canterbury Tales. It was one of the first books to
be printed by William Caxton, the first person in England to
print books using a printing press.

---

By 1400, in England, official documents were being written
in English, and English had become the preferred language
of the royal court and Parliament.

---

After the Norman Conquest, the king and his noblemen had
spoken Norman French and the peasants had continued to
speak Anglo-Saxon. Gradually these two languages
combined to become one English language.

---

In England, judges developed ‘common law’ by a process
of precedence (that is, following previous decisions) and
tradition. In Scotland, the legal system developed
slightly differently and laws were ‘codified’ (that
is, written down).

---

A similar Parliament developed in Scotland. It had three
Houses, called Estates: the lords, the commons and the
clergy.

---

The nobility, great landowners and bishops sat in the House
of Lords. Knights, who were usually smaller landowners,
and wealthy people from towns and cities were elected to sit
in the House of Commons. Only a small part of the population
was able to join in electing the members of the Commons.

---

There were few formal limits to the king’s power until
1215. In that year, King John was forced by his noblemen to
agree to a number of demands. The result was a charter of
rights called the Magna Carta (which means the Great
Charter)

---

In the Middle Ages, Parliament began to develop into the
institution it is today. Its origins can be traced to the
king’s council of advisers, which included important
noblemen and the leaders of the Church.

---

Following the Black Death, the smaller population meant
there was less need to grow cereal crops. There were labour
shortages and peasants began to demand higher wages. New
social classes appeared, including owners of large areas
of land (later called the gentry), and people left the
countryside to live in the towns

---

In 1348, a disease, probably a form of plague, came to
Britain. This was known as the Black Death. One third of the
population of England died and a similar proportion in
Scotland and Wales.

---

The same system developed in southern Scotland. In the
north of Scotland and Ireland, land was owned by members of
the ‘clans’

---

Some peasants had their own land but most were serfs.

---

The Normans used a system of land ownership known as
feudalism. The king gave land to his lords in return for help
in war.

---

English kings also fought a long war with France, called the
Hundred Years War (even though it actually lasted 116
years). One of the most famous battles of the Hundred Years
War was the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, where King Henry
V’s vastly outnumbered English army defeated the
French. The English largely left France in the 1450s.

---

Many knights took part in the Crusades, in which European
Christians fought for control of the Holy Land.

---

By 1200, the English ruled an area of Ireland known as the
Pale, around Dublin. Some of the important lords in other
parts of Ireland accepted the authority of the English
king.

---

The English first went to Ireland as troops to help the Irish
king and remained to build their own settlements.

---

In 1314 the Scottish, led by Robert the Bruce, defeated the
English at the Battle of Bannockburn, and Scotland
remained unconquered by the English.

---

By the middle of the 15th century the last Welsh rebellions
had been defeated. English laws and the English language
were introduced.

---

In 1284 King Edward I of England introduced the Statute of
Rhuddlan, which annexed Wales to the Crown of England. Huge
castles, including Conwy and Caernarvon, were built to
maintain this power

---

Broadly speaking, the Middle Ages (or medieval period)
spans a thousand years, from the end of the Roman Empire in
476 AD up until 1485.

---

William send people all over England to draw up lists of all
the towns and villages. This was called the Domesday Book.
It still exists today and gives a picture of society in
England just after the Norman Conquest.

---

Initially the Normans also conquered Wales, but the welsh
gradually won territory back. The Scots and the Normans
fought on the border between England and Scotland. The
Normans took over some land on the border but did not invade
Scotland.

---

Norman French, the language of the new ruling class,
influenced the development of the English language.

---

The Norman Conquest was the last successful foreign
invasion of England.

---

William became king of England and is known as William the
Conqueror. The battle is commemorated in a great piece of
embroidery, known as the Bayeux Tapestry, which can still
be seen in France today.

---

In 1066, an invasion led by William, the Duke of Normandy (in
what is now northern France), defeated Harold, the Saxon
king of England, at the Battle of Hastings.

---

In the north, the threat of attack by Vikings had encouraged
the people to unite under one king, Kenneth MacAlpin. The
term Scotland began to be used to describe that country.

---

Anglo-Saxon kings continued to rule what is now England,
except for a short period when there were Danish kings. The
first of these was Cnut, also called Canute.

---

Many of the Viking invaders stayed in Britain. Especially
in the east and north of England, in an area known as the
Danelaw (many place names there, such as Grimsby and
Scunthorpe, come from the Viking languages).

---

The Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in England united under king
Alfred the Great, who defeated the Vikings.

---

The Vikings came from Denmark, Norway and Sweden. They
first visited Britain in 789 AD to raid coastal towns and
take away goods and slaves. Then, they began to stay and form
their own communities in the east of England and Scotland.

---

St. Augustine led missionaries from Rome, who spread
Christianity in the south. St. Augustine became the first
Archbishop of Canterbury.

---

St. Columba, who founded a monastry on the island of Iona,
off the coast of what is now Scotland.

---

Missionaries from Ireland spread the religion in the
north. The most famous of these were St. Patrick, who would
become patron saint of Ireland.

---

Parts of west britain, including much is now Wales, and
Scotland, remained free of Anglo-Saxon rule.

---

The burial place of one of the kings was at Sutton Hoo in
modern Suffolk.

---

By about 600 AD anglo-saxon kingdoms were established in
britain.

---

Britain was again invaded by tribes from northern Europe.
the Jutes, the Angles and the Saxons. The languages they
spoke are the basis of modern-day English.

---

The Roman army left britain in 410 AD to defend other parts of
the Roman empire and never returned.

---

The Romans remained in Britain for 400 years. They built
roads and public buildings, created a structure of law, and
introduced new plants and animals. It was during the 3rd and
4th centuries AD that the first Christian communities
began to appear in Britain.

---

Parts of Hadrian's Wall, including the forts of
Housesteads and Vindolanda, can still be seen. It is a
popular area for walkers and is a UNESCO World Heritage
Site.

---

Areas of what is now Scotland were never conquered by the
Romans, and the Emperor Hadrian built a wall in the north of
England to keep out the Picts ( ancestors of the Scottish
people).

---

One of the tribal leaders who fought against the Romans was
Boudicca, the queen of Iceni in what is now eastern England.
She is still remembered today and there is a statue of her on
Westminster Bridge in London, near the Houses of
Parliament.

---

Julius Caesar led a Roman invasion of Britain in 55 BC. This
was unsuccessful and for nearly 100 years Britain remained
separate from the Roman Empire. In 43 AD the Emperor
Claudius led the Roman army in a new invasion.

---

Most people were farmers, craft workers or warriors. The
language they spoke was part of the Celtic language family.

---

A very impressive hill fort can still be seen today at Maiden
Castle, in the English county of Dorset.

---

People still lived in roundhouses, grouped together into
larger settlements, and sometimes defended sites called
hill forts.

---

People lived in roundhouses and buried their dead in tombs
called round barrows.

---

Around 4000 years ago, people learned to make bronze.

---

Skara Brae on Orkney, off the north coast of Scotland.

---

Stonehenge, still stands in what is now the English county
of Wiltshire.

---

The first farmers arrived in Britain 6000 years ago. The
ancestors of these farmers probably came from south-east
Europe.

---

Britain only became permanently separated from the
continent by the Channel about 10000 years ago.

---

There are several islands which are closely linked with the
UK but are not part of it. The Channel islands and the Isle of
Man. These have their own governments and are called 'Crown
Dependencies'. There are also several British overseas
territories in other parts of the world, such as St. Helena
and the Falkland Islands. They are also linked to the UK but
are not a part of it.

---

I will give my loyalty to the United Kingdom and respect it's
rights and freedoms. I will uphold it's democratic values.
I will observe it's laws faithfully and fulfil my duties and
obligations as a British citizen.

---

The fundamental principles of British life include: *
Democracy * The rule of law * Individual liberty * Tolerance
of those with different faiths and beliefs * Participation
in community life
